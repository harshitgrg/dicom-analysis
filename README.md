#The complete dataset can be downloaded from here: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/APOLLO-1-VA#4fbe448b42cc4ace8b278fccf2813f19

# I have preprocessed scans of files in folder named as AP6H6G(as given by you) in this.
# For the 3D Visualization,(preprocessing_scans_AP6H6G_update1)(with NO ERRORS) there is no output of 3D Visualization because of the large dataset, it is taking time, and update 2 contains output but no colours in the model because of older attribute used in Matplotlib.
#The update 1 is to be followed.
