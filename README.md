# data-analysis-diwali 

# I have preprocessed scans of files in folder named as AP6H6G(as given by you) in this.
# For the 3D Visualization,(preprocessing_scans_AP6H6G_update1)(with NO ERRORS) there is no output of 3D Visualization because of the large dataset, it is taking time.
# However I assure you the code is correct as I have also uploaded similar file github with name as 
# preprocessing_scans_AP6H6G_update2(with output but with no colour, I forgot to add colour attribute in matplotlib.
